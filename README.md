# Low-Level-Flight-Controller-

>A Low-Level Flight controller algorithm i.e., Attitude controller is implemented with the Teensy 3.6 Microcontroller.

>Below picture shows the Flight controller board that we have developed in our lab.

Fig:-Flight Controller Board

>It contains the BNO055 as a IMU Sensor which outputs the Euler Angles for the feedback input for attitude controller algorithm.

> We have used the hexacopter frame i.e., six multi rotors for this Flight controller board.
